# MarketIfTouchedOrder

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | Option<**String**> | The Order's identifier, unique within the Order's Account. | [optional]
**create_time** | Option<**String**> | The time when the Order was created. | [optional]
**state** | Option<**String**> | The current state of the Order. | [optional]
**client_extensions** | Option<[**models::ClientExtensions**](ClientExtensions.md)> |  | [optional]
**r#type** | Option<**String**> | The type of the Order. Always set to \"MARKET_IF_TOUCHED\" for Market If Touched Orders. | [optional]
**instrument** | Option<**String**> | The MarketIfTouched Order's Instrument. | [optional]
**units** | Option<**String**> | The quantity requested to be filled by the MarketIfTouched Order. A posititive number of units results in a long Order, and a negative number of units results in a short Order. | [optional]
**price** | Option<**String**> | The price threshold specified for the MarketIfTouched Order. The MarketIfTouched Order will only be filled by a market price that crosses this price from the direction of the market price at the time when the Order was created (the initialMarketPrice). Depending on the value of the Order's price and initialMarketPrice, the MarketIfTouchedOrder will behave like a Limit or a Stop Order. | [optional]
**price_bound** | Option<**String**> | The worst market price that may be used to fill this MarketIfTouched Order. | [optional]
**time_in_force** | Option<**String**> | The time-in-force requested for the MarketIfTouched Order. Restricted to \"GTC\", \"GFD\" and \"GTD\" for MarketIfTouched Orders. | [optional]
**gtd_time** | Option<**String**> | The date/time when the MarketIfTouched Order will be cancelled if its timeInForce is \"GTD\". | [optional]
**position_fill** | Option<**String**> | Specification of how Positions in the Account are modified when the Order is filled. | [optional]
**trigger_condition** | Option<**String**> | Specification of which price component should be used when determining if an Order should be triggered and filled. This allows Orders to be triggered based on the bid, ask, mid, default (ask for buy, bid for sell) or inverse (ask for sell, bid for buy) price depending on the desired behaviour. Orders are always filled using their default price component. This feature is only provided through the REST API. Clients who choose to specify a non-default trigger condition will not see it reflected in any of OANDA's proprietary or partner trading platforms, their transaction history or their account statements. OANDA platforms always assume that an Order's trigger condition is set to the default value when indicating the distance from an Order's trigger price, and will always provide the default trigger condition when creating or modifying an Order. A special restriction applies when creating a guaranteed Stop Loss Order. In this case the TriggerCondition value must either be \"DEFAULT\", or the \"natural\" trigger side \"DEFAULT\" results in. So for a Stop Loss Order for a long trade valid values are \"DEFAULT\" and \"BID\", and for short trades \"DEFAULT\" and \"ASK\" are valid. | [optional]
**initial_market_price** | Option<**String**> | The Market price at the time when the MarketIfTouched Order was created. | [optional]
